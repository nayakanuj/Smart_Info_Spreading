# Smart Information Spreading

## Smart information spreading for opinion maximization in social networks.

## Description
This repository is based on the paper - [Smart Information Spreading for Opinion Maximization in Social Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8737538). 

## TL;DR:
This paper introduces a novel approach to opinion maximization in social networks by leveraging smart information spreading instead of simply identifying influential nodes. Using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), the problem is framed as a sequential decision process, where multiple sources inject informationâ€”one strategically and others randomly. The study develops centralized and decentralized learning algorithms to approximate solutions and, through simulations, shows that smart spreading significantly outperforms random spreading, even when placed at a disadvantageous position in the network.
